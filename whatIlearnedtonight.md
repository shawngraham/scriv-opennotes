http://rmflight.github.io/posts/2014/07/vignetteAnalysis.html\

-you need devtools, roxygen2, knitr all loaded up. 

-you create a new project from the existing directory, once you've done his 'create' thing

-put the data within that folder, don't leave it running around; /inst/extdata

-all of this is within a github repo

-fix the description file

-create a vignette file

-set the tools, project options etc

need this too: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/formatting.html

and this: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html


-you can use the scrivener + github template for all the ancillary writing, put it in the same repo

-use gitignore to sort out the cruf
