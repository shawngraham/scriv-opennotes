#Thoughts on using Scrivener + Github as an Open Notebook
(See also https://github.com/carsomyr/scrivener_starter)

1. Here’s the thought. I use scrivener for taking all of my notes, chronicling experiments, whatever. 

2. I save in github repo, and commit all changes.

3. I periodically update this initial notecard with a ‘state of where this project is at’.

4. I compile everything into a single markdown document.

5. I name it ‘readme.md’ and put it at the top level of the repo.

## I can use subheadings, but I’ll only use h1 at the top of each card.
+ That should work.
