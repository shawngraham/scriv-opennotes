#Thoughts on using Scrivener + Github as an Open Notebook
(See also https://github.com/carsomyr/scrivener_starter)

1. Here’s the thought. I use scrivener for taking all of my notes, chronicling experiments, whatever. 

2. I save in github repo, and commit all changes.

3. I periodically update this initial notecard with a ‘state of where this project is at’.

4. I compile everything into a single markdown document.

5. I name it ‘readme.md’ and put it at the top level of the repo.

6. It occurs to me that it would be useful to take the ‘files’ folder and batch convert all the file endings to .md for display on github.

## I can use subheadings, but I’ll only use h1 at the top of each card.
+ That should work.

#This is a tangent

It’s the first notecard in a new folder. I don’t know how this’ll look at the end.
